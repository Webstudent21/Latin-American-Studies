<p>There was a lot of social tension and many slave revolts that happened before the Haitian Revolution so you may be asking yourself what exactly caused something as significant as the Haitian Revolution?
  Well here are some factors that helped create the perfect circumstances for the Haitian Revolution to take place.</p>

<p><b>The French Revolution</b>- The Haitian revolution was inspired by the French Revolution Which took place between 1787 and 1799.
  The French Revolution has some similarities to the Haitian Revolution because in The French Revolution Peasants were revolting against the monarchy due to them being heavily taxed and having poor living conditions compared to the rich.
  The Haitian Revolution is similar because an oppressed group of people are fighting for their freedom and independence.The enslaved colored people of Saint domingue where inspired by the French Revolution and were ready to fight for their rights as well.
  The french revolution was also responsible for the creation of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citzen.This document stated that all men were equal and should be granted the same rights after hearing about this document opressed groups were more motivated
  to fight for there rights.The french revolution.The French revolution was mainly caused by the poor economic situation in france which meant that peasants and the middle class were starving and had poor living conditions.Inaddition to this peasants and the middle classes
  were also heavily taxed while the privileged class was completely exempt from taxation.Those who were in the upper class were oblivious to the sruggles that lower class citzens faced.This unequality angered the lower class citzens and as result they fought to overthrow
  the monarchy.The french revolution was significant because it was a turning point in history were the people overthrew a monarch and created a democracy.There are clear similarities between the french revolution and the haitian revolution.The french revolution also created
  turmoil in france giving the slaves a good oppurtunity to fight for there own indepence from france. </p>

<p><b>Free colored people being granted citizenship</b>-Free colored people were given full citizenship and had way more wealth, freedom and rights compared to slaves.However they still had less rights compared to the
  white planters so free colored people still faced some discrimination.As a result Free colored people were usually allies to enslaved colored people,and since free colored people had more power and were more educated
  than enslaved colored people they really helped the slaves gain independence.As a matter of fact Toussaint L'Ouverture was a former slave who led the haitain revolution.</p>

<p><b>Slaves outnumbered their owners 10:1</b>-90% of the population were slaves in saint domingue.So slaves had the numbers to start a revolt overpower the planters who were only about 10% of the population.
 This was very important because without a huge advantage in numbers the slave revolt would not be successful since slaves were at a disadvantage when it came to weapons.
 The spread of disease from new slaves being brought to saint domingue also helped the slaves revolt since disease killed many planters as well further reducing the slave owner population.</p>
