<h1>Important People and events</h1>

<h2>Social Classes</h2>

<h2> Declaration of the rights of man and citzens</h2>

<p>In 1789 the Declaration of the rights of man and citizen was created.This document stated that all men were created equal and that all men had certain natural inalienable rights.This Document is significant because it helped spark the Haitian Revolution.While the Declaration claimed that all men are equal and should be granted rights in reality both free and enslaved people did not have the same rights as Plantation owners.This blatant double standard encourage people of color to revolt which is part of the reason why the Haitian revolution began.The declaration of the rights of man claimed that all men are created but this document did not apply to people of color and women.Which is why Marie gouze wrote the declaration of women's rights to show that women were excluded from what was stated in the declaration.This civil rights document essentially added fuel to the fire by excluding the most oppressed groups like people of color and women.</p>
